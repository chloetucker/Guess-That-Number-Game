## Reflection
- I learned that the more I can integrate my interests into side projects, the more engrossing they will be
- I learned that even as a beginner, I can have fun with simple concepts

## Resources
This game was based on a Guess That Number game listed as App 2 in the following course: <a href="https://github.com/mikeckennedy/python-jumpstart-course-demos" target="_blank">**Talk Python to Me - Building 10 Apps Course**</a>

## Ideas to Improve
- Expand the narrative to have the computer be Gandalf, and a battle scenario to occur when Sauron, Saruman, or Gollum user names are entered.
- Add PEP8 style conventions
